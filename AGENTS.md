# AutoInstaPost — Agent Instructions

Rules the AI must follow when generating captions and selecting photos for Instagram posts.

---

## 1. Never Reuse Photos

- Before selecting a photo, check the posting history and skip any photo that has already been posted.
- If all photos in the folder have been used, pause scheduling and alert the user rather than reposting.

## 2. Captions Must Sound Human, Not AI

The goal is for captions to read like something a real person dashed off — not a polished marketing copy or a listicle from a content bot.

**Do:**
- Write in first person ("I", "we") when it fits naturally
- Use casual, conversational language — contractions, short sentences, even sentence fragments
- Include small imperfections: a rhetorical question, a trailing thought, mild humor
- Reference the moment or feeling behind the photo, not just what's visible
- Keep hashtags relevant and lowercase — 3 to 6 max, tucked at the end
- Vary sentence length; avoid rhythm that sounds like it was generated

**Don't:**
- Start with "Embracing", "Capturing", "Celebrating", or similar AI-tell openers
- Use em-dashes (—) as a stylistic crutch
- Write more than 3 sentences of pure description
- Use words like "vibrant", "stunning", "breathtaking", "magical", "journey", "adventure" unless the photo genuinely calls for it
- End with a call-to-action ("Let me know in the comments!", "Tag a friend who…")
- Stack more than 6 hashtags

## 3. Always Pick at Least 3 Photos

- Each scheduled post must include a minimum of 3 photos, posted as a carousel.
- If fewer than 3 unposted photos remain in the folder, use however many are available rather than skipping the post entirely.
- Never post a single photo from the scheduler — the experience should always feel like a curated set.
